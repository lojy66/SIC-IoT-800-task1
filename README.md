1. File & Working Tree Operations
 
git mv
Use: Moves or renames a file, directory, or symlink, while automatically tracking the change in Git's index.
Example: git mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
 
git restore
Use: Restores files in your working directory or staging area (index) to a previous state, discarding uncommitted changes.
Example: git restore main.cpp
 
git rm
Use: Removes files from the working tree and stages the removal for the next commit.
Example: git rm file.txt
 
2. Advanced History & Commit Management
 
git stash
Use: Temporarily shelves (saves) uncommitted changes you've made to your working tree so you can switch branches or pull updates without having to commit half-done work.
Example: git stash (to save changes) and git stash pop (to bring them back).
 
git rebase
Use: Reapplies your commits on top of another branch. It rewrites the commit history to create a clean, straight line instead of a branching merge web.
Example: git rebase main
 
git cherry-pick
Use: Allows you to select a specific commit from one branch and apply its changes directly to your current branch.
Example: git cherry-pick 1a2b3c4
 
3. Collaboration & Teamwork (Working with Others)
 
git blame
Use: Shows exactly who last modified each line of a file and in which commit. Very useful when working in a team to find out who wrote a specific piece of code or introduced a bug.
Example: git blame index.html
 
git fetch
Use: Downloads updates (branches and commits) from a remote repository to your local machine, but does not automatically merge them into your working files. It lets you inspect your teammate's work before integrating it.
Example: git fetch origin
 
git pull --rebase
Use: Fetches a teammate's changes from the remote repository and rebases your local unpushed commits on top of them. This prevents the unnecessary "merge commits" that clutter the history when two people work on the same branch.
Example: git pull --rebase origin main
 
git merge --squash
Use: Takes all the commits from a teammate's branch and squashes them into a single, clean commit on your current branch. Great for keeping the main branch history readable.
Example: git merge --squash feature-branch
 
git log --graph
Use: Displays a visual text-based graph of the commit history in your terminal. It helps you easily see where branches diverged and where your teammates merged their work.
Example: git log --graph --oneline --all
 
4. Emergency & Branch Management
 
git reset --hard
Use: Acts like a time machine. It rewinds your branch to a specific older commit and completely wipes out any changes made in the working directory after that point. Use with extreme caution.
Example: git reset --hard 1a2b3c4
 
git revert
Use: Safely undoes a previous commit by creating a brand-new commit that reverses the changes. This is the safest way to undo a mistake that has already been pushed to a shared repository without rewriting history.
Example: git revert 1a2b3c4
 
git commit --amend
Use: Modifies the most recent commit. Useful for fixing a typo in your last commit message or adding a file you forgot to stage, without cluttering the history with a whole new commit.
Example: git commit --amend -m "Corrected typo in the previous message"
 
git checkout -b
Use: Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it in one single step. Perfect for starting isolated work on a new feature or task quickly.
Example: git checkout -b new-feature
